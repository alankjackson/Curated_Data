```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)

path <- "/home/ajackson/Dropbox/Rprojects/Curated_Data_Files/CoH_Address_Points/"

filename <- "COH_PDD_ADDRESS_POINTS_-_PDD.csv"

df <- read_csv(paste0(path, filename),
               col_types="nnccccccccccccccnnccccccccccccccc")

```

##    Quality control and Explore

Data read in mostly as character, except for lat long and xy coordinates.

Let's explore each column, with an eye towards possibly transforming them to 
a better data type (dates should be dates, for example)

```{r QC and Explore}
