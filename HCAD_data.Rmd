## Harris County Appraisal District

Files read from https://hcad.org/pdata/ for each of the years 2005-2020

Really only want one file out of the zip file, the file real_acct.txt.

These files are large, so I will drop as much data as possible as 
quickly as possible.


```{r read files}

zipfile <- paste0(path, "HCAD/Real_acct_owner_2005.zip")

df <- readr::read_tsv(unz(description = zipfile, filename = "real_acct.txt"), col_names = TRUE, col_types = strrep("c", 71)) %>% 
  select(acct, yr, contains("str_"), contains("site_addr"), bld_ar, land_ar,
         land_val, bld_val, assessed_val, tot_appr_val, tot_mkt_val,
         new_own_dt)

#   Are there more columns I can drop?

```
