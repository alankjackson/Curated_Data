```{r setup, include=FALSE}

library(leaflet)

path <- "/home/ajackson/Dropbox/Rprojects/Curated_Data_Files/Flood_Plains/"

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

Hard to download. Kept failing, took many tweaks to get it to work. A very
non-intuitive interface (thank you Arcgis).

```{r read and plot}

fgdb <- paste0(path, "FEMA_Floodplains_NFHL_2015.dbf")

# Read the feature class
temp <- sf::st_read(fgdb)

summary(temp)
#   Good epsg

leaflet(temp) %>% 
  leaflet::setView(lng = -95.3103, lat = 29.7752, zoom = 8 ) %>%   
  addTiles() %>% 
  addPolygons()

```
