##    Read in county files

Read in two file, the county file by csv for building a table of standard
county names and FIP code correspondence, and also then read in the shapefile
for actually drawing county outlines on a map.

```{r read CSV}

Counties <- read_csv(paste0(path, "Texas_County_Boundaries.csv")) %>% 
  select(-SHAPE_Length, -SHAPE_Area)

# The state has problems spelling this corectly

Counties$CNTY_NM[Counties$CNTY_NM=="De Witt"] <- "DeWitt"

# Save file out

saveRDS(Counties, paste0(path, "County_Names.rds"))

```
